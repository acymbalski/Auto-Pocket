## Introduction

Auto-pocket is a tool designed to automate the addition and removal of articles into your personal pocket account. It was designed primarily for use with Kobo ereaders to provide a daily selection of news articles to your reader for a newspaper like experience. 

Using the config file, you can setup a series of RSS news feeds that shall be added to your pocket account and automatically removed after a configurable amount of time to avoid your account getting out of hand. 

All articles uploaded are tagged with an auto-pocket tag and a further tag of your choice to provide a level of seperation. 

Lastly the program accepts input of a URL from the command line. This can be useful for integration with other applications such as newsbeuter.
